# An attempt to build a multilingual personal blog.

Hello World! Salamu Dunia!

I have been wishing to start writing a blog for a while now. It seems to be the cool thing to do these days. Everybody seems have one. I wanted mine though to be in several languages. I speak a bit of English but it's frankly not the language I had been used to speak in my early childhood days. Swahili is the language I grew up speaking from as early as I can remember but fortunately or unfortunately, my education has been dominated by English as the language of instruction. So I wanted to have a blog that was in both my native language and in English. This turns out to not be as simple as I first expected. After a couple of weeks of trial and error, skimming and scanning gists and posts on stackoverflow, I think I might have the foundation to start building one.

Feedback and suggestions are very welcomed.
