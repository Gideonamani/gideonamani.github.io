## About Me

I don't know where to start really. This is a bit a tricky for me. It's hard to condense what one thinks about oneself into a few words on a page on the internet. Also, there might be particular specifics that you're keen on and interested in, and I think it's asking too much of me to know what they really are. Rather than me just write everything about myself, that I think people might want to know here, on this page; I'd prefer you just read it somewhere in my biography a hundred years from now. Thus, a slightly more resonable approach of you getting to know about me is by getting in touch.

Cheers.
