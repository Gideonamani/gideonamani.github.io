# Markdown text styles, examples, samples and reference

This is just a simple note to self. To be used as a quick reference when I am writing some content in markdown.

## Headers
Put a pound/hash/octothorpe `#` symbol then space before you start writing the header text. Mind you, this should be on a new line and NOT in the middle, somewhere in between the text.

There are six heading magnitudes. One Octothorpe is for the largest header and Six Octothorpes for the smallest header.

`# Header 1`

`## Header 2`

`### Header 3`

`#### Header 4`

`##### Header 5`

`###### Header 6`

Will result into =>

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

## Paragraphs and font-styles
* Paragraph: Just write, there is no special syntax for this. Make sure to leave an __emply line__ between two sequential paragraphs.
* Bold: `__some text__` => __some text__

## Lists

## Anchor Links

## Quotes

## Images

## Tables
